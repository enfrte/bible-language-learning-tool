# Bible language learning tool

This app displays side-by-side bible verse translations in various languages. This is allegedly how language learning was done in the past. I personally like this approach because the Bible is a great book, and translations are done very well.

## Developer notes

* Thanks to the good folks at http://getbible.net/ for the use of their API.
* Thanks to https://github.com/bkuhl/bible-verse-counts-per-chapter/blob/master/bible.json for the json. 
* I'm new to Vue so the code is not very well structured. At some point I'll start writing Vue apps with components :P
* I haven't tested this well with all the different languages.
